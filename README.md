# AI Agent Information Retrieval Project

## Project Description
This project is a Streamlit-based AI agent that allows users to upload a dataset, select an entity column, and retrieve specific information for each entity by querying web search results. The app leverages SerpAPI to perform searches based on user-defined prompts and displays the relevant results in a structured format. Users can also download the results as a CSV file for further analysis.
