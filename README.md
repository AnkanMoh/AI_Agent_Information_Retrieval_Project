# AI Agent Information Retrieval Project

## Project Description
This project is a Streamlit-based AI agent that allows users to upload a dataset, select an entity column, and retrieve specific information for each entity by querying web search results. The app leverages SerpAPI to perform searches based on user-defined prompts and displays the relevant results in a structured format. Users can also download the results as a CSV file for further analysis.This is the link to my Loom Video where you can find the video description of the project- https://www.loom.com/share/02876d5f2ad348339312e1cc01bde1f0?sid=9398bf73-0413-45b4-acf6-f5d5b6186c9d
